## Background
We've choosen to focus on the IoT-track where JCDecaux and futurice gave us 
the challenge to hack a connected interactive bus stop supercharged by a huge 
monitor driven by a web browser.

## Idea
Our idea is to create a a window between remote locations in the world.
We will achive this by equiping every bus stop with a real time camera and then
connect it with another random bus stop somewhere in the world. 

## Technology choices
As the bus stops are already built on web technologies we've choose to focus on
using modern web API's for peer to peer video communications coupled with a
JSON REST API backend for matchmaking random bus stops around the world.
