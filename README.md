## Background
We've choosen to focus on the IoT-track where JCDecaux and futurice gave us 
the  challenge to hack a connected interactive busstop supercharged by a huge 
monitor driven by a web browser.

## Idea
Our idea is to create a a window between remote locations in the world.
We will achive this by equiping every busstop with a real time camera and then
connect it with another random busstop somewhere in the world. 

## Technology choices
As the busstops are already built on web technologies we've choose to focus on
using modern web api's for peer to peer video communications coupled with a
json rest api backend for matchmaking random busstops around the world.
